            <h2>20W LED Bulb</h2>
            <p><span>Super Safe LED Bulb Professional Lighting Features:</span> <br><br>
                <span>Eco-Safe & Healthy:</span> Completely free of hazardous mercury, radioactive chemicals, and UV radiation, ensuring a safer and more environmentally friendly lighting solution.
                <br><span>Exceptional Energy Efficiency:</span> Consumes up to 90% less energy compared to traditional nominal lighting, significantly reducing operational costs and environmental impact.
                <br><span>Superior Light Quality:</span> Features high Color Rendering Index (CRI) and efficient Correlated Color Temperature (CCT) for vibrant, accurate color representation and optimal visual clarity.
                <br><span>Professional-Grade Reliability:</span> Engineered for minimal lumen depreciation, maintaining consistent light output over time, making it ideal for demanding professional and commercial applications.
                <br><span>Long Service Life:</span> Boasts an extended lifespan of 30,000 hours, minimizing maintenance frequency and replacement costs.

                <br><span>Breakdown of the Benefits:</span>100% hazardous Mercury, radioactive chemical & UV ray free
                <br><span>Benefit:</span> This is a major safety and environmental selling point. It means the lights are safer to dispose of, pose no risk of mercury contamination, and won't cause fading or damage to artworks or fabrics from UV exposure. It's a "green" and healthy choice.Energy efficient and energy saves up to 90%

                <br><span>Benefit:</span> Direct cost savings on electricity bills. This is often the primary reason for upgrading to LED technology. The return on investment (ROI) is very clear.High CRI and efficient CCT
                <br><span>Benefit:</span>
                <br><span>High CRI (Color Rendering Index):</span> Colors look more true-to-life and vibrant. This is critical in retail settings, art galleries, kitchens, and anywhere accurate color perception is important.
                <br><span>Efficient CCT (Correlated Color Temperature):</span> Offers the right "feel" of light (e.g., warm white for cozy spaces, cool white for focused tasks) without wasting energy.Minimum Lumen depreciation and can be used as professional lightings
                <br><span>Benefit:</span> The light won't get significantly dimmer over its lifetime. This consistency is essential for professional environments like offices, hospitals, and factories, where maintaining a specific light level is crucial for safety and productivity.

                <br><span>Long Lifespan:</span> 30000 Hrs
                <br><span>Benefit:</span> Drastically reduces long-term maintenance and replacement costs. A 30,000-hour lifespan means years of reliable service before a replacement is needed, even with heavy use.
